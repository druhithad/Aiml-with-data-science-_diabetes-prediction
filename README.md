Diabetes Prediction using AIML:
This project is an AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language) based solution to predict the likelihood of a person having diabetes. It uses a dataset of medical features to predict diabetes and serves as an example of how machine learning and artificial intelligence can be applied for medical prediction.

Features
Data-Driven: The model uses a dataset of medical data to predict diabetes.

Real-time Prediction: The system can be used for predicting diabetes in real-time based on user input.

AIML Integration: AIML-based chatbot that can answer user queries about diabetes and prediction results.

Installation
To use or contribute to this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-prediction-aiml.git
Navigate to the project directory:


cd diabetes-prediction-aiml
Install the necessary dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Launch the model script or AIML bot:


python diabetes_predictor.py
You can also start the AIML chatbot if integrated separately:


python aiml_chatbot.py
Dataset
This project uses a diabetes dataset that includes various health metrics such as age, BMI, glucose levels, and insulin levels. The dataset can be found in diabetes_data.csv.

Usage
After running the script, the model will ask for inputs such as age, BMI, glucose levels, etc.

Based on the inputs, the model will output a prediction of whether the user has a high likelihood of having diabetes.

Example input:


Age: 45
BMI: 28
Glucose: 160
Example output:



Predicted Outcome: Diabetes (High Probability)
Technologies Used
AIML: For creating the intelligent chatbot interface.

Python: Main programming language for the machine learning model.

Scikit-learn: For building and training the machine learning model.

Pandas and NumPy: For data manipulation and processing.
